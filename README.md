#Traffic Light Detection using Image Processing and Computer Vision

Welcome to the repository for the Traffic Light Detection project, developed as part of the MSc course in Image Processing and Computer Vision. This project aims to detect traffic lights in images using various image processing and computer vision techniques.

Key Features:
	Image Processing Techniques: Utilization of Gaussian blur and color space transformations for image preprocessing.
	Traffic Light Detection: Detection of red, green, and yellow traffic lights using color thresholding and Hough circle detection.
	User Interface: Integration with Tkinter for selecting input and output directories.

Main Components:
	Main Script: Entry point for the application, handles the user interface and image processing pipeline.
	Image Processing Functions: Implementation of functions for image preprocessing and traffic light detection.
	User Interface: Definition of the Tkinter GUI for selecting input and output directories.

Installation:
	Ensure you have Python installed. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

Usage:
	Run the main script to select input and output directories and execute the traffic light detection process.
 
	$ python main.py
